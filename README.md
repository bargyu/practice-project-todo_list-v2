# practice-project-todo_list-v2
ToDo list app v2 (JS/html/css)

This version has a standalone delete button, where the labeltext does not get strike-through format when the list element text gets it. This was not possible to get solved in the first version because the button was not a standalone element rather as part of the list element just the text was formatted differently.

Mostly wrtitten by AI, I just supervised it. Graphic elements are also AI created.
